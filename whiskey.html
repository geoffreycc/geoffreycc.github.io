      <h2>Are You Experience - Learn the Whiskey Experience</h2>
    <setion>
<article> <p>Even if you are an experienced whisky taster, there are probably a lot of terms and phrases that you don&rsquo;t really understand. Here is a guide to the most common whisky terminology. Feel free to use these at your next tasting and sound like a total expert.</p>

<p><strong>Alcohol by volume (ABV)</strong>: As the name suggests, this is the proportion of alcohol as a percentage of the total volume. A higher number means a stronger whisky.</p>

<p><Strong>Body</strong>: This is a hard term to explain, but it basically refers to the way a whisky feels in your mouth. A whisky that seems to flood your mouth with flavor has a lot of body.</p>

<p><strong>Cask</strong>: The barrel in which the whisky was aged, usually made of oak. This is the source of much of the distinctive woody flavor of whisky.</p>

<p><Strong>Complex</strong>: Having many layers and elements. A more complex whisky is one that you can taste and discuss for hours. A more complex whisky is not always the best, although it</p>

<p><Strong>Dram</strong>: A serving of whisky (the exact amount can vary).</p>

<p><Strong>Finish</strong>: The moments after you have swallowed a whisky; also, the flavors and experiences you encounter during this time.</p>

<p><Strong>Legs</strong>: The way a whisky acts when swirled in a glass. A more viscous whisky will stick to the side of the glass, giving it ‘legs’ while a thinner whisky will not.</p>

<p><Strong>Malt</strong>: A process in which starch is converted to sugar. Malts have a distinctive taste that is appreciated by fine palates. Grain that is soaked in water and then dried begins to malt, adding a new flavor to the whisky it grvaces.</p>

<p><Strong>Mouthfeel</strong>: This means exactly as it sounds: the way a whisky feels in your mouth. This is usually due to viscosity and other physical factors, although the flavors can definitely have an effect on the way a mouthfeel is perceived.</p>

<p><Strong>Palate</strong>: This can refer to one of two things: the time in which a whisky is in your mouth, or the individual flavors present in the drink.</p>

<p><Strong>Peat</strong>: The fuel over which malted barley is dried. This gives Scotch whisky its distinctive flavor and smokiness.</p>

<p><Strong>Proof</strong>: Twice the ABV. This is an old English way of ranking the alcohol content, but all you have to remember is that it is exactly two times the ABV, so an 80 proof whisky is 40% ABV.</p>

<p><Strong>Viscous</strong>: Having a slightly thicker, stickier mouthfeel. A viscous whisky will also have more defined legs when it is swirled slightly in the glass.</p>

<p>These are not the only words that you will hear at a whisky tasting, but with this vocabulary you should be able to talk intelligently and descriptively about your experiences.</p></article>
